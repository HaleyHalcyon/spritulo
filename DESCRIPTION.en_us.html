    Spritulo ("<i>sprit-<b>oo</b>-loh</i>") is a block-script handwriting font with massive multilingual support spanning Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. It started as a project to create a modern handwriting font for Ancient Greek, but has since expanded to include a diverse character set including Vietnamese and Bulgarian Cyrillic. It is based on the handwriting of the designer using a felt-tip pen, with some creative liberties and beautification added in.

    The two-story lowercase “g”, the two-storey lowercase “a”, and the old-style numerals are rare for a handwriting font. If these idiosyncracies are unwanted, there are alternate letterforms as OpenType features, including single-storey “a”, single-storey “g”, and lining numerals.
</p>
<p>
    The Cyrillic letterforms blend block-script versions with some cursive features. Style Set 01 strengthens the cursive influence; it is activated by default in Bulgarian.
</p>
<p>
    The Greek letterforms are intended for use as mathematical symbols. For an environment with Greek text, the designer recommends activating Style Set 02, which was modeled after a native Greek speaker’s handwriting.

    <i>Spritulo</i> is Esperanto for “witticist” or “clever guy”, composed of <i>sprit(a)</i> “witty” and <i>-ulo</i> [person characterized by said feature]. This name continues the Esperanto theme from the designer’s previous Google Font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orelega+One">Orelega One</a>.
