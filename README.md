# Spritulo

Spritulo is a block-script handwriting font with massive multilingual support spanning Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. It started as a project to create a modern handwriting font for Ancient Greek, but has since expanded to include a diverse character set including Vietnamese and Bulgarian Cyrillic. It is based on the handwriting of the designer using a felt-tip pen, with some creative liberties and beautification added in.

The Cyrillic letterforms blend block-script versions with some cursive features.

*Spritulo* is Esperanto for “witticist” or “clever guy”, from *sprit(a)* “witty” and *-ulo* “[person characterized by said feature]”. Its Esperanto name continues the theme from my previous Google Fonts project, [Orelega](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orelega+One).

## Known issues

* Exported .ufo3 has a broken features.fea file. Loading it on FontForge removes all OpenType features except kerning. Thanks, FontForge.
* Glyph names do not match the Google Fonts standard.
